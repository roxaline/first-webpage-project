        <p>These are the meaning of each of the fun things we talked above, things that dogs like,they are followed as listed:</p>
        <ul>
         <ol>
            <li>In agility trials, human handlers guide dogs off lead through obstacle courses that consist of hurdles, teeter-totters, tunnels, balance beams, weave poles, climbing structures, etc. Agility trials can be very competitive, or they can be done just for fun. Dogs gain confidence, release energy and learn how to stay focused while in high spirits.</li>
            <li>Dogs, like people, love to get away from it all! If you’re going on a backpacking trip with your dog, plan ahead. Taking a dog out on the trail without some type of fitness conditioning can be dangerous to your dog’s health. Fitness doesn’t come overnight, so start the process well before your trip. Check with a local authority to see if pets are allowed in the area where you’ll be trekking; some places allow dogs, but require permits. Carry a first-aid kit for you and your dog, and know how to administer basic first aid if your dog becomes injured. At any time of year, remember to pack enough water for you and your dog.</li>
            <li>Most dogs love to ride in the car. Take your dog along if you’re visiting friends or family. For a special treat, include a side trip to do some shopping with your dog. Some dogs love to browse at pet supply stores (many of which allow you to bring your dog inside). Your dog may ask for a treat or two, so be prepared to spend a little money on this outing!</li>
            <li>A choreographed set of moves, performed to music, freestyle musical dance is done by dogs in partnership with their handlers. If you have not seen this new “sport” in action, you will be amazed at the level of expertise that can be achieved through teamwork, focus, and practice, practice, practice. Get more information about freestyle musical dance with dogs.</li>
            <li>Dogs who love to play Frisbee, either purely for pleasure or in competition, are called disc dogs. Some dogs won’t allow their people to play without them! If your dog loves to play ball, you may want to buy a disc and get your dog involved in this great form of exercise. One word of caution, however: This sport involves a lot of jumping, so consult with your veterinarian before starting your dog on a vigorous Frisbee training program. Get more information about playing Frisbee with your dog.</li>
            <li>All dogs should receive some obedience training. How far you take it is up to you – some people want their dogs to compete in serious obedience trials, while others just want a dog who will obey simple cues in daily life. In either case, both you and your dog will enjoy the benefits of better communication and the increased bond between you that results from time spent together teaching, learning, and practicing. For more information, call your local animal shelter and ask for a referral for a training class.</li>
            <li>If you haven’t taken a vacation with your dog, give it some thought. It can be very rewarding to have your dog along on your adventure, and many hotel chains accept dogs these days</li>
            <li>Playing hide-and-seek with a toy or item of clothing can be a tracking challenge for your dog. In winter, a fun game is to place a glove (with a treat inside for extra enticement) just under the surface of the snow.</li>
